					<p>I was born on January 25, 2003 in Pomona, California. I went to Pepper Tree Elementary for grade K-6 and then went to Pioneer Jr. High for grade 7 and 8. I am currently attending Damien High School as a Sophomore in my second year. 
					<p>Every year during the summer I either go to England or Japan because my dad is from England and my mom is from Japan.</p>
					<p>I started playing soccer when I was 4 years old. I started playing on indoor turf in the Arena in Upland. When I was in the first grade, I started playing on a Japanese team called the LA Hawks because I had some other Japanese friends that were also on that team. I played with them until the fifth grade. In the sixth grade I joined Legends FC and played with them for three years. I am currently on Arsenal when I joined them early this year.</p>
